\# Real State Project



\## Objective

Analyze real estate data to understand price distribution, the relationship between property size and price, and differences across locations.



\## Tools Used

\- Python

\- Pandas

\- Seaborn

\- Matplotlib

\- Jupyter Notebook



\## Files

\- `real\_state\_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis

\- `data/properties\_dataset.csv`: Dataset used in the project



\## Project Description

\- Analyzed price and size distributions using visualizations.

\- Used Boxplots to compare prices across different locations.

\- Created a Heatmap to explore correlations between variables.

\- Scatter plots show the relationship between property size and price.

\- Insights help understand the market and evaluate properties more effectively.



\## How to Run

1\. Open `real\_state\_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

2\. Make sure the `data/` folder contains `properties\_dataset.csv`.

3\. Run all cells to see the results and visualizations.
